- Designed to be a budget console, so parts and overall build quality are cheap
- Hinge is both flimsy and very thin, meaning it cracks/breaks easily
- Known to have bad ICs, meaning very high rates of FCRAM and NAND failures
- Is liable to turn to dust when attempting to do repairs. (not an exaggeration)
- Overall barely any cheaper than a New 3DS XL, which is a vastly better model
