If so, we suggest looking for one made by Cameron Sino. These can mostly be found on eBay; avoid buying them from places like AliExpress or Amazon, as those websites are known to have fake listings. You should always verify the battery you received is real on their site, and if it does not pass validation, then return the item and try another seller. 
For supported countries check out [Wurm's site](<https://shop.wurmforge.com/?wt_coupon=nhuser>)  for a trusted reseller of them. Use `NHUSER` for 5% off.
** Country Notices **
- US Buyers: Be careful, depending on where you order, you may have to pay the carrier and tariff fees.
- HK/Chinese Buyers: Sino no longer allows sales to your country, effective June 16th 2025.
